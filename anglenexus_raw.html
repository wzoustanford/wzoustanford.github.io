<b>Angle</b> builds Reinforcement Learning Foundational Models and Agents, taking real-world actions and learn from experience. <b>Nexus</b> is a high-velocity application operating system assited by RL agents. Together, the goal of AngleNexus is to serve AI application builders, entrepreneurs, enterprises to create AI applications with real-world impact.

<h2 align="left"> Angle </h2>
<p style="width:75%">
Angle is the foundational Reinforcement Learning model effort supported by research. 

The application domains are planning, travel, finance, GenAI alignment, and gaming. 

With a deep Reinforcement Learning Model, generative LLM models are less likely to hallucinate, because it does not take into account of penalties and rewards of taking real actions. It is our view a foundational Reinforcement Learning model is the way to go in the next 5-10 years for intelligence systems in production.

<h3 align="left">Reinforcement Learning Foundational Model</h3>
<p style="width:75%">
We build a Reinforcement Learning model and a machine learning infrastructure to support this foundation model. Interested in the RL algorithms we use? We are serious and actively working on research.

<p style="width:75%">
Why do we build an AI infra for RL? 
</p> 
<p style="width:75%">
<p style="width:75%">
<b>Unified AI infra platform for Reinforcement Learning</b>. Due to the research nature of RL and the lack of open-source systems, even OpenAI, Anthropic and DeepMind struggle to unified the reinforcement learning AI infra systems. This is due to the divergence of environment states, action spaces, reward/policy/advantage models, and RL techniques. The need for research on general solutions motivates a generic platform for any engineer to productionize an RL model, and efficiently benchmkark, experiment the technique.
</p> 
<b>High calibre decisions and Experiment platform for reliable production</b>. The ML iterations are more frequent and more intense for RL Compared with LLM which generates words, the impact of each RL decision carry a higher value. Engineering excellence, efficient algorithms and distributed systems mean a world of difference to capture signals.

<h2 align="left"> Nexus </h2>
Nexus is the distributed operating system for AI on the internet.

For AI applications, LLM cannot autonomously and successfully handle engineering actions with web services and distributed systems. Nexus provides a platform to build AI application as an operating system. With this Nexus OS, it will be easy for everyone to use and leverage their AI applications, and make it scalable and fast for companies to build AI products. We aim for anyone to easily access any AI applications or build their own.

Nexus provides the platform to construct AI applicatios with RL, serve and deploy and grow users. This is not limited tou LLM training/serving, nor conventional agentic execution and workflows for enterprise. We leverage Angle to train foundational RL agents to build microservices data-storage or simple compute platforms, and the vision is to have AI assisted automation of microservices, UX building and maintenance. AI will be the assistant builder, and will be the on-call maintainer of the services. At Nexus, it is fast to iterate and prototype products with AI-driven design, implementation, testing, and data-driven product development.

<h3 align="left">Sophon</h3>
<p style="width:75%">
Sophon is the agent that determines what users see. We use Sophon to discover, show interactive interfaces, run programs, and adapt to user's preference.
</p> 
<p style="width:75%">
For a demo of Sophon on mobile, we show a chat system. The user experience is defined by generative AI. When user inputs the prompt, the generative AI interprets the request, and calls relevant UX, backend components to offer a comprehensive response. The interface is customized to and steerable by the user. In this example, a interactive stock chart was loaded, a browser was loaded to look for information for CEO's, and a pdf viewer together with back-end database was called to display financial reports of the companies asked. Sophon is a system platform that allows services, systems, interfaces to be operable and steerable.

<h3 align="left">Weaver</h3>
<p style="width:75%">
Weaver is the agent that weaves a web of information and connects the users questions to the most up-to-date information. We use Weaver to find the user-customized, the most suitable, and the most updated information source. Weaver is ensured to act very fast, and is a nimble superhero.Try weaver with your own prompt (this demo is for asking financial questions):

<h2 align="left"> Who is Nexus (AI Microservices)? </h2>
  
<p style="width:75%">
Nexus is the distributed operating system for AI on the internet. 
</p>
<p style="width:75%">
We believe the future of web applications starts with AI, be it social, search, finance, education, travel, medical, legal. However, AI and LLM cannot autonomously interact with web services and distributed systems. So all AI applications are now custom-built without an operating system layer, thus are all built with custom programs. Nexus provides a platform to build AI applications, and this platform is an operating system. With this Nexus OS, it will be easy for everyone to use and leverage their AI applications, and make it scalable and fast for companies to build AI products. Nexus OS aims to provide necessary components, layers, interfaces for AI to operate on the web like an operating system. From the perspective of the user it’s as easy as using the PC operating system to do stuff. We aim for anyone to easily access any AI applications or build their own.
</p>
<p style="width:75%">
  We can construct AI applicatios with AI/LLM, serve and deploy and grow users. This is not limited to LLM training/serving, nor agentic execution and workflows, we leverage expert engineers to train AI/LLMs to build, interact with microservices, before they are able to design interfaces and deploy data-storage or simple compute platforms, and the vision is to have AI assisted automation of microservices, UX building and maintenance. AI will be the assistant builder, and will be the on-call maintainer of the services. At Nexus, it will be fast to iterate and prototype products with AI-driven design, implementation, testing, and data-driven product development. 
</p> 
  
<h2 align="left"> What stage are you?  </h2>

<p style="width:75%">
We’ve built a vertical application with UX, graphs, widgets, data-bases, search, crawlers. We are now building the AI horizontal infra. The first version of the product consists of two LLM scoring play-grounds, one for UX/front end, for reasoning LLMs to author UX interfaces on the fly either in conversation or customize what the user sees. The second play-ground is used to teach LLMs to reason and call microservice interfaces, such as get data, search, store data, parse and interpret. Put together, a vertical application is built and highly customizable by the user through the agentic AI system. 
</p> 
<p style="width:75%">
Our approach is build a ‘lego world’ for AI. This ‘lego world’ is composed of front end user UX and distributed data systems. In both worlds, we work with excellent engineers to design reliable, versatile, effective lego blocks (widgets) for AI to understand, manipulate, and customize.
</p> 

<h3 align="left">Sophon</h3>
<p style="width:75%">
Sophon is the agent that determines what users see. We use Sophon to discover, show interactive interfaces, run programs, and adapt to user's preference.
</p> 
<p style="width:75%">
For a demo of Sophon on mobile, we show a financial advisor system. The user experience is defined by generative AI. When user inputs the prompt, the generative AI interprets the request, and calls relevant UX, backend components to offer a comprehensive response. The interface is customized to and steerable by the user. In this example, a interactive stock chart was loaded, a browser was loaded to look for information for CEO's, and a pdf viewer together with back-end database was called to display financial reports of the companies asked. Sophon is a system platform that allows services, systems, interfaces to be operable and steerable.

<h3 align="left">Weaver</h3>
<img align="right" src="http://ai.stanford.edu/~wzou/images/weaver_demo_terminal.png" height=450> 
<p style="width:75%">
Weaver is the agent that weaves a web of information and connects the users questions to the most up-to-date information. We use Weaver to find the user-customized, the most suitable, and the most updated information source. Weaver is ensured to act very fast, and is a nimble superhero.Try weaver with your own prompt (this demo is for asking financial/stock questions): 
</p> 
<p style="width:75%">
curl -X POST http://54.148.152.214:8000/weaver -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"user_input": "Retrieve the full annual income statement data for Amazon.com Inc. for the past 5 years, focusing on net profit, revenue, and operating expenses. Calculate the year-on-year growth rates for each metric and present the results.", "history": []}'

<h2 align="left"> Why you?  </h2>
<p style="width:75%">
  We are and we hire the best AI infra experts in the world, we understand AI, infra and applications/products. 
</p> 

<h2 align="left">  Why now? </h2>
<p style="width:75%"> 
  It is prime time to launch Nexus. LLM foundational model companies (openAI, anthropic, perplexity) are focusing on model development, architecture, 2C user experience. Larger corporations (google, meta) are building custom implementation in their products, which have limited success. (this is not public information because competition, but e.g. Llama products consists of less 5% of meta’s revenue). However, there is significant market demand from all the rest of the world, who only have access to e.g. chatGPT api, and no internal infra, especially a feasible guideline or handbook to implement their AI application. We provide that as an operating system, so everyone can start building their AI applications more easily.
</p>

<h2 align="left"> Customers </h2>
<p style="width:75%"> 
Corporations - enterprise technical teams will support corporation internal teams leverage the latest Nexus OS technology. Enterprises focus on their products and often hire teams to explore AI applications, which are not yet successful. Nexus helps enterprises launch successful, revenue generating products that is proven on other verticals. Nexus provide the teams, technical expertise for key enterprise customers to ensure their success
</p>
<p style="width:75%"> 
Incubators, early stage companies - (e.g. clerky for product development) startups can easily launch applications on the Nexus OS, it aims to be the goto-prototyping platform for all early stage companies. The founders won’t have to hire large teams or spend significant energy sifting through nuanced technical skill sets, but leverage the existing OS layer to build applications with a few engineers. Nexus aims to cut prototyping cost by 70%. 
</p>
<p style="width:75%"> 
Mid-stage companies - whenever user growth and product development is critical, Nexus will be the platform to plug in for AI integration to existing applications by customers. Nexus will provide the fastest product iteration cycles leveraging latest AI infra microservices that are ready to deploy. Nexus is ready to plug in user growth, reinforcement learning and bandit technologies that are tailored for customers and AI/LLMs. 
</p>
<p style="width:75%"> 
Personal - subscription - create your dreams. Anyone can be enabled by Nexus to build their simple apps, such as family shopping lists, health/training tracker, stock picker, trip planner, birthday reminders. This can be easily supported through the existing ‘lego blocks’ existent in Nexus’ development library, or by using ‘build mode’ to modify and test the code, which is Shell for Nexus.

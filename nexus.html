<h2 align="left"> Who is Nexus (AI Microservices)? </h2>
<p style="width:75%">
Nexus is the distributed operating system for AI on the internet. Nexus is also a product builder with AI that interact with humans on any device. We believe the future of applications starts with AI, be it social, search, finance, education, travels, medical, legal, yet AI is still to develop the capability to deploy, interact, learn with distributed systems and micro-services. That’s why all application layer products are now custom-built, we build the platform to build AI applications for start-ups, enterprise and grow users. This platform is built as a distributed operating system such that it has the available component, layers, interfaces like an operating system, and to the user it’s as easy as using the PC operating system to make and use an application. We aim for anyone to easily build their AI applications.

<p style="width:75%">
  We can construct AI applicatios with AI/LLM, serve and deploy and grow users. This is not limited to LLM training/serving, nor agentic execution and workflows, we leverage expert engineers to train AI/LLMs to build, interact with microservices, before they are able to design interfaces and deploy data-storage or simple compute platforms, and the vision is to have AI assisted automation of microservices, UX building and maintenance. We maintain that it’s a vain and difficult to maintain and scale what you didn’t build, the same goals for AI. The future will be fast product building and iterations, and AI-driven design, implementation, testing, and data-driven product development.

<h2 align="left"> What stage are you?  </h2>

<p style="width:75%">
We’ve built a vertical application with UX, graphs, widgets, data-bases, search, crawlers, . We are now building the AI horizontal infra. The first version of the product consists of two LLM scoring play-grounds, one for UX/front end, for reasoning LLMs to author UX interfaces on the fly either in conversation or customize what the user sees. The second play-ground is used to teach LLMs to reason and call microservice interfaces, such as get data, search, store data, parse and interpret. Put together, a vertical application is built and highly customizable by the user through the agentic AI system. 
</p> 
<p style="width:75%">
Our approach is build a ‘lego world’ for AI. This ‘lego world’ is composed of front end user UX and distributed data systems. In both worlds, we work with excellent engineers to design reliable, versatile, effective lego blocks (widgets) for AI to understand, manipulate, and customize.

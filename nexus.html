<h2 align="left"> Who is Nexus (AI Microservices)? </h2>
<p style="width:75%">
Nexus is the distributed operating system for AI on the internet. Nexus is also a product builder with AI that interact with humans on any device. We believe the future of applications starts with AI, be it social, search, finance, education, travels, medical, legal, yet AI is still to develop the capability to deploy, interact, learn with distributed systems and micro-services. That’s why all application layer products are now custom-built, we build the platform to build AI applications for start-ups, enterprise and grow users. This platform is built as a distributed operating system such that it has the available component, layers, interfaces like an operating system, and to the user it’s as easy as using the PC operating system to make and use an application. We aim for anyone to easily build their AI applications.

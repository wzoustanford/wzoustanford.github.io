<b>Angle</b> builds Reinforcement Learning Foundational Models and Agents, taking real-world actions and learn from experience. <b>Nexus</b> is a high-velocity application operating system assited by RL agents. Together, the goal of AngleNexus is to serve AI application builders, entrepreneurs, enterprises to create AI applications with real-world impact.

<h2 align="left"> Angle </h2>
<p style="width:75%">
Angle is the foundational Reinforcement Learning model effort supported by research. 

The application domains are planning, travel, finance, GenAI alignment, and gaming. 

With a deep Reinforcement Learning Model, generative LLM models are less likely to halucinate, because it does not take into account of penalties and rewards of taking real actions. It is our view a foundational Reinforcement Learning model is the way to go in the next 5-10 years for intelligence systems in production. 
</p>

<h3 align="left">Reinforcement Learning Foundational Model</h3>
<p style="width:75%">
We build a Reinforcement Learning model and a machine learning infrastructure to support this foundation model. Interested in the RL algorithms we use? We are serious and actively working on research.

<p style="width:75%">
Why do we build an AI infra for RL? 
</p> 
<p style="width:75%">
<p style="width:75%">
<b>Unified AI infra platform for Reinforcement Learning</b>. Due to the research nature of RL and the lack of open-source systems, even OpenAI, Anthropic and DeepMind struggle to unified the reinforcement learning AI infra systems. This is due to the divergence of environment states, action spaces, reward/policy/advantage models, and RL techniques. The need for research on general solutions motivates a generic platform for any engineer to productionize an RL model, and efficiently benchmkark, experiment the technique.
</p> 
<b>High calibre decisions and Experiment platform for reliable production</b>. The ML iterations are more frequent and more intense for RL Compared with LLM which generates words, the impact of each RL decision carry a higher value. Engineering excellence, efficient algorithms and distributed systems mean a world of difference to capture signals.

<h2 align="left"> Nexus </h2>
Nexus is the distributed operating system for AI on the internet.

For AI applications, LLM cannot autonomously and successfully handle engineering actions with web services and distributed systems. Nexus provides a platform to build AI application as an operating system. With this Nexus OS, it will be easy for everyone to use and leverage their AI applications, and make it scalable and fast for companies to build AI products. We aim for anyone to easily access any AI applications or build their own.

Nexus provides the platform to construct AI applicatios with RL, serve and deploy and grow users. This is not limited tou LLM training/serving, nor conventional agentic execution and workflows for enterprise. We leverage Angle to train foundational RL agents to build microservices data-storage or simple compute platforms, and the vision is to have AI assisted automation of microservices, UX building and maintenance. AI will be the assistant builder, and will be the on-call maintainer of the services. At Nexus, it is fast to iterate and prototype products with AI-driven design, implementation, testing, and data-driven product development.

<h3 align="left">Sophon</h3>
<p style="width:75%">
Sophon is the agent that determines what users see. We use Sophon to discover, show interactive interfaces, run programs, and adapt to user's preference.
</p> 
<p style="width:75%">
For a demo of Sophon on mobile, we show a financial chat system. The user experience is defined by generative AI. When user inputs the prompt, the generative AI interprets the request, and calls relevant UX, backend components to offer a comprehensive response. The interface is customized to and steerable by the user. In this example, a interactive stock chart was loaded, a browser was loaded to look for information for CEO's, and a pdf viewer together with back-end database was called to display financial reports of the companies asked. Sophon is a system platform that allows services, systems, interfaces to be operable and steerable.

<h3 align="left">Weaver</h3>
<p style="width:75%">
Weaver is the agent that weaves a web of information and connects the users questions to the most up-to-date information. We use Weaver to find the user-customized, the most suitable, and the most updated information source. Weaver is ensured to act very fast, and is a nimble superhero.Try weaver with your own prompt (this demo is for asking financial/stock questions):

<p style="width:75%">
curl -X POST http://54.148.152.214:8000/weaver -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"user_input": "Retrieve the full annual income statement data for Amazon.com Inc. for the past 5 years, focusing on net profit, revenue, and operating expenses. Calculate the year-on-year growth rates for each metric and present the results.", "history": []}'

<h2 align="left"> Why you?  </h2>
<p style="width:75%">
We have the technology to build deep Foundational AI models from publich financial data. We have the deep RL technology to generate reveune and offer investment insights. We are advised by top academics and finance industry experts, and plan to hire AI, infra and product engineering experts. 
</p> 

<h2 align="left">  Why now? </h2>
<p style="width:75%"> 
It is prime time to launch Angle. There is no significant force to build a Reinforcement Learning Foundational Model for finance. Individual investors and households have been deprived of public financial intelligence for too long. Hedge Funds, financial institutions, large banks are playing catchup even with LLM foundational model companies (openAI, anthropic, perplexity) are focusing on model development, architecture, 2C user experience. Larger corporations are building custom implementation in their products, which have limited success. However, there is significant market demand from all the rest of the world, who only have access to e.g. chatGPT api, and no internal infra, especially a feasible guideline or handbook to implement their AI application. We provide the applicatin for every house hold to access financial information, and speak with generative AI which access all of public data and generate UX elements. It's time to make investing fair for all houshold investors. 
</p>

<h2 align="left"> Customers </h2>
<p style="width:75%"> 
Enterprises and institutions - enterprise technical teams will support corporation internal teams to leverage the latest deepRL/GenAI infra technology. We focus on investor serving enterprises like wealth management firms and retirement funds. Angle provide the teams, technical expertise for key enterprise customers to ensure their success, both for equity selection and for customer facing applications. 
</p>
<p style="width:75%"> 
Household - subscription. Anyone can be enabled by Angle to be informed of the investment world, deep RL insights, and make the best decisions with their money. 
</p>
<p style="width:75%"> 
Rewards - points like system when household put their money on Angle fund, they can be exchanged for household items the atomic family really needs, children's books, a playset, a bike, a computer.

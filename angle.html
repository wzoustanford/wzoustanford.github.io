<h2 align="left"> What is Angle.ai? </h2>
  
<p style="width:75%">
Angle.ai utilizes generative AI, and deep reinforcement learning to democratize investing for all households. Financial data in banks were compiled by thousands of analysts working late nights digging through reports. This gave the investment edge to large banks and hedge funds, relying on data sources that cost millions. In contrast, there are over 100 million household investors in the US how are powerless in the face of financial data. With the advent of generative AI, there is little that an analyst can do that AI and machine learning cannot do. We are building a low-cost machine learning platform to serve individual investors, households, investor-serving enterprises, who can benefit from investment insights which were only available to investment banks with armies of analysts. We build a revenue generating deep reinforcement learning system, learning on public data, and is online 24-7 to provide interesting, clear, and intelligent insights. Join us, the rebels who will start the household investing revolution.

<p style="width:75%">
We believe the future of web applications starts with AI, be it social, search, finance, education, travel, medical, legal. However, AI and LLM cannot autonomously interact with web services and distributed systems. So all AI applications are now custom-built without an operating system layer, thus are all built with custom programs. Nexus provides a platform to build AI applications, and this platform is an operating system. With this Nexus OS, it will be easy for everyone to use and leverage their AI applications, and make it scalable and fast for companies to build AI products. Nexus OS aims to provide necessary components, layers, interfaces for AI to operate on the web like an operating system. From the perspective of the user it’s as easy as using the PC operating system to do stuff. We aim for anyone to easily access any AI applications or build their own.
</p>
<p style="width:75%">
  We can construct AI applicatios with AI/LLM, serve and deploy and grow users. This is not limited to LLM training/serving, nor agentic execution and workflows, we leverage expert engineers to train AI/LLMs to build, interact with microservices, before they are able to design interfaces and deploy data-storage or simple compute platforms, and the vision is to have AI assisted automation of microservices, UX building and maintenance. AI will be the assistant builder, and will be the on-call maintainer of the services. At Nexus, it will be fast to iterate and prototype products with AI-driven design, implementation, testing, and data-driven product development.

<h2 align="left"> What stage are you?  </h2>

<p style="width:75%">
We’ve built a vertical application with UX, graphs, widgets, data-bases, search, crawlers. We are now building the AI horizontal infra. The first version of the product consists of two LLM scoring play-grounds, one for UX/front end, for reasoning LLMs to author UX interfaces on the fly either in conversation or customize what the user sees. The second play-ground is used to teach LLMs to reason and call microservice interfaces, such as get data, search, store data, parse and interpret. Put together, a vertical application is built and highly customizable by the user through the agentic AI system. 
</p> 
<p style="width:75%">
Our approach is build a ‘lego world’ for AI. This ‘lego world’ is composed of front end user UX and distributed data systems. In both worlds, we work with excellent engineers to design reliable, versatile, effective lego blocks (widgets) for AI to understand, manipulate, and customize.

<h3 align="left">Sophon</h3>
<p style="width:75%">
Sophon is the agent that determines what users see. We use Sophon to discover, show interactive interfaces, run programs, and adapt to user's preference.
</p> 
<p style="width:75%">
For a demo of Sophon on mobile, we show a financial advisor system. The user experience is defined by generative AI. When user inputs the prompt, the generative AI interprets the request, and calls relevant UX, backend components to offer a comprehensive response. The interface is customized to and steerable by the user. In this example, a interactive stock chart was loaded, a browser was loaded to look for information for CEO's, and a pdf viewer together with back-end database was called to display financial reports of the companies asked. Sophon is a system platform that allows services, systems, interfaces to be operable and steerable.

<h3 align="left">Weaver</h3>
<p style="width:75%">
Weaver is the agent that weaves a web of information and connects the users questions to the most up-to-date information. We use Weaver to find the user-customized, the most suitable, and the most updated information source. Weaver is ensured to act very fast, and is a nimble superhero.Try weaver with your own prompt (this demo is for asking financial/stock questions):

<h2 align="left"> Why you?  </h2>
<p style="width:75%">
  We have the technology to generate insights from publich financial data through LLM. We have the deep RL technology to generate reveune and offer investment insights. We plan hire AI, infra and product experts. 
</p> 

<h2 align="left">  Why now? </h2>
<p style="width:75%"> 
It is prime time to launch Angle. LLM foundational model companies (openAI, anthropic, perplexity) are focusing on model development, architecture, 2C user experience. Larger corporations are building custom implementation in their products, which have limited success. However, there is significant market demand from all the rest of the world, who only have access to e.g. chatGPT api, and no internal infra, especially a feasible guideline or handbook to implement their AI application. We provide the applicatin for every house hold to access financial information, and speak with generative AI which access all of public data and generate UX elements. It's time to make investing fair for all houshold investors. 
</p>

<h2 align="left"> Customers </h2>
<p style="width:75%"> 
Enterprises and institutions - enterprise technical teams will support corporation internal teams to leverage the latest GenAI/deepRL infra technology. We focus on investor serving enterprises like wealth management firms and retirement funds. Angle provide the teams, technical expertise for key enterprise customers to ensure their success, both for equity selection and for customer facing applications. 
</p>
<p style="width:75%"> 
Personal - subscription. Anyone can be enabled by Angle to be informed of the investment world, deep RL insights, and make the right decisions with their money.
